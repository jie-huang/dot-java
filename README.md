# Why to create a Java wrapper for dot?
dot is a great tool to create graph. For a simple job, writing dot file manually is easy.
But, in some case, it is not so convenient to generate a graph automatically with dynamic data.
e.g., to generate a flow status graph of a running pipeline.

Another one, with a Java wrapper, it leverages Java IDE to auto-complete and format the generate file.
Even more, it can avoid a lot of unnecessary spell errors.
